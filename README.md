# module-10-homework

## Description
The challenge for this module was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes information about employees on a software engineering 
team and generates an HTML webpage that displays user inputed information for each person. Also writing unit tests for each part of my code.

I used javascript and the inquirer package 8.2.4
